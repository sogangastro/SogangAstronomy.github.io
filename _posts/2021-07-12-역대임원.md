description: "Inspired by Deep Mind's astonishing feats of having their Alpha Go, Alpha Zero and Alpha Star programs learn (and be amazing at it) Go, Chess, Atari games and lately Starcraft; I set myself to the task of programming a neural network that will learn by itself how to play the ancient game of tic tac toe. How hard could it be?"
